        Remembering my grand-father's stories about Polynesian reefs, I took on the adventure of discovering
        coral reefs ecology during my second year of master degree & could not consider another path for myself ever since.

         My research focuses on <b>coral-associated ecosystems</b>, especially within the Kuroshio region. I am based in Taiwan &
         currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.oc.ntu.edu.tw/oceng/" target="_blank">Institute of Oceanography of National Taiwan University</a> (IONTU-FRElab).

         I have an interest on both modern & paleo-reefs as past ecosystems can hold crucial informations for scientists to better understand reef ecosystems & predict their future in the ongoing changing era.
         However, the reciproque is also true. It is important to have a good knowledge of reef's functioning using today's reefs in order understand past-reefs functioning & their trajectories through geological periods.

             To date [09/2022], we performed field investigations in 97 locations, using transect and photo-quadrat methods. Our survey includes numerous remote islets
             such as Penjiayu (彭佳嶼), Mianhuayu (棉花嶼), Huapingyu (花瓶嶼), Turtle Island (龜山島), Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼), Xiaoliuqiu (小琉球), Penghu archipelago (澎湖) as well as remote sites such as Qixingyan (七星岩). <br>

          <h4>MPAs in Taiwan:</h4>
        <p align="justify">
             In Taiwan, numerous governing agencies are implementing various MPAs types & do not necessarly consults each other in their establishment or management, occasionally leading to complex overlap between MPAs & managing agencies 
             (<i>see examples shown in the maps below</i>). Such situations are unlikely to provided better or more efficient ecosystems & resource management,
             highlighting the necessity for a nationwide evaluation of the different types of MPAs existing in Taiwan and a better consultation between the various governing agencies involved in MPAs implementation and management.
