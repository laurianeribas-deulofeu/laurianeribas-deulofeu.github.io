        Reminiscing about my grand-father's stories about Polynesian reefs, I embarked on the adventure of discovering
        coral reefs ecology during my second year of master's degree & have not consider another path for myself ever since.

       <p align="justify">
         
         Since <b>November 2024</b>, I have relocated to Norway to begin a postdoctoral contract at Nord University, applying emerging <b>AI approaches to marine biodiversity and Invasive Alien Species (IAS) across Europe</b>.
         These projects are part of the BioBoost+ (Biodiversa+) and GuardIAS (Horizon Europe) initiatives (Grant agreement nos. 101181413 & 101052342).
         More detailed information coming soon. <br>
         


         <b>Previously (2021-2024)</b>
         My research focuses on <b>coral-associated ecosystems</b>, particularly within the Kuroshio region. Currently based in Taiwan, I serve as a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.oc.ntu.edu.tw/oceng/" target="_blank">Institute of Oceanography of National Taiwan University</a> (IONTU-FRElab).

         I have a keen interest in both modern & paleo-reefs, as past ecosystems can provide valuable information for scientists striving to better understand reef ecosystems & predict their future in the ongoing changing era.
        Conversely, understanding present-day reef functioning is equally essential for deciphering the dynamics of past reefs & their evolution across geological periods

            As of July 2023, we have conducted field investigations in 101 locations, employing transect and photo-quadrat methods. Our survey encompasses numerous remote islets
             such as Penjiayu (彭佳嶼), Mianhuayu (棉花嶼), Huapingyu (花瓶嶼), Turtle Island (龜山島), Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼), Xiaoliuqiu (小琉球), Penghu archipelago (澎湖) as well as remote sites like Qixingyan (七星岩). <br>

          <h4>MPAs in Taiwan:</h4>
        <p align="justify">
             In Taiwan, numerous governing agencies are implementing various types of MPAs without necessarly consulting each other in their establishment or management. This can occasionally lead to complex overlap between MPAs &/or managing agencies 
             (<i>see maps below</i>). Such situations are unlikely to provided better or more efficient ecosystems management,
             highlighting the necessity for a countrywide evaluation of the different types of MPAs existing in Taiwan & better consultation between the various governing agencies involved in both the implementation & management of MPAs.
