          As earth faces anthropogenically-driven climate changes, marine ecosystems are facing a wide range of changes including intensification of severe weather events & increased sea surfacetemperatures.
          The fastest ocean warmings have been observed in subtropical to temperate regions influenced by poleward-flowing boundary currents like the Kuroshio Current. XXX

            <h4 align="justify">2012 - TAIKOR project: Describing high-latitude scleractinian communities in Jeju Island</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          While doing my second year of master degree intership in Dr. Chaolun Allen Chen's (BRCAS, Taiwan), I got involved in the TAIKOR project to collaborate with scientists from EWHA university (Seoul, South Korea) & KIOST (Busan, South Korea).
          In this project, we surveyed Jeju's Benthic communities at 5 & 15 m depths. We also sampled coral colonies to document the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-015-1286-y" target="_blank"><b>diversity of zooxanthellae associating with scleractinian corals in Jeju Island</b></a>.
          Since the 2012-initial survey, 3 additional sites have been added to the project (2013). Our findings have already led to several publications (<i>e.g.</i>,<a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12526-013-0195-y" target="_blank">Denis et al. 2014a</a>), 
                especially on the high coral cover & recruitment rate of <i>Alveopora japonica</i> (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-013-1019-z" target="_blank">Denis et al. 2014b</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5343/bms.2014.1032" target="_blank">Denis et al. 2015</a>).
          Further publications are currently under review, describing the benthic compositions surrounding Jeju Island & investigating the warming of the ocean alongside the loss of seasonnality over the last 40 years (Ribas-Deulofeu et al., <i>under review</i>).
