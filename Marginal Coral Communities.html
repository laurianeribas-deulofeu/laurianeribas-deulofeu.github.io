        <p align="justify">
          As the earth faces anthropogenically-driven climate changes, marine ecosystems are facing a wide range of changes including intensification of severe weather events & increased sea surface temperatures. 
          The fastest ocean warmings have been observed in subtropical to temperate regions influenced by poleward-flowing boundary currents like the Kuroshio Current. 
          In parallel, tropical reefs have suffered rapid deterioration from repeated mass bleaching events, ocean acidification & numerous anthropogenic pressures. 
          In this context, subtropical and temperate environments could become potential refuge habitats for some vulnerable (sub)tropical taxa that have the ability to escape adverse conditions by tracking their optimal environments. 
          Therefore, it becomes crucially important to determine the extent to which high-latitude benthic communities could offer refuge to (sub)tropical taxa in the near future. 
          Furthermore, at many locations, the lack of quantitative data describing benthic community baselines often represents a limit to our interpretation of the changes that are happening.<br>

        <p align="justify">
          While doing my second year of master's degree internship in Dr. Chaolun Allen Chen's lab (BRCAS, Taiwan), I got involved in the TAIKOR project to collaborate with
          scientists from EWHA University (Seoul, South Korea) & KIOST (Busan, South Korea). In this project, we surveyed Jeju's Benthic communities at 5 & 15 m depths. We also
          sampled coral colonies to document the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-015-1286-y" target="_blank">diversity of zooxanthellae associated with
          scleractinian corals in Jeju Island (de Palmas et al. 2014)</a>.Since the 2012-initial survey, three additional sites were added to the project (2013). Our findings have
          already led to several publications (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12526-013-0195-y" target="_blank">Denis et al. 2014a</a>), especially on the 
          high coral cover & recruitment rate of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-013-1019-z" target="_blank"><i>Alveopora japonica</i> 
          (Denis et al. 2014b</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5343/bms.2014.1032" target="_blank"> Denis et al. 2015)</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Further publications are currently under review, describing the benthic compositions surrounding Jeju Island & investigating the warming of the ocean alongside the loss of 
          seasonality over the last 40 years (Ribas-Deulofeu et al., <i>under review</i>). This paper will provide us with the necessary baseline knowledge on Jeju's benthic composition
          upon which we will be able to quantify the extent of tropicalization of these communities & their abilities to serve as high-latitude refuges to tropical taxa in the near future.</b><br>

        <p align="justify"> 
            During our survey in October 2012, we observed wide beds of <i>Alveopora japonica</i> covering an estimated area >1Ha, between 10-17 m depth in Biyangdo
            at the western corner of Jeju Island <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-013-1019-z" target="_blank">(Denis et al. 2013)</a>. This field was punctuated
            by stands of the endemic Kelp <i>Ecklonia cava</i>. This observation in Jeju Island brought to light a similar pattern than previously observed in certain 
            marginal regions of Japan, suggesting potential persistent shifts from kelp-dominated forests to coral-dominated states. Further investigations in October 
            2013 on <i>A. japonica</i> showed an extraordinarily high density of recruits (7,590Â±660 recruits/m<sup>2</sup>). <i>A. japonica</i> may be colonizing Jeju
            Island & other marginal regions more aggressively than previously expected & need to be the focus of further research in high-latitude regions, especially 
            as it is likely to induced important loss of economically important kelp species such as <i>E. cava</i> in these regions.

          <p align="justify">
             To date, 28 species of scleractinian corals have been mentioned as inhabiting Jeju Island waters. Among them, our team was the first to report
             <a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12526-013-0195-y" target="_blank">the presence of <i>Psammocora albopicta</i> in Jeju Island (Denis et al. 2014)</a>.
             In 2012, our team observed <i>P. albopicta</i> in three surveyed sites: Biyangdo, Jigwido & Seogwipo from 5 to 10 m depth. At these locations, we also noted the
             association between <i>P. albopicta</i> & the bivalve <i>Leiosolenus lischkei</i>, which constitute a new host record for <i>L. lischkei</i>.

          <b>Further efforts in describing scleractinian corals & their associated organisms inhabiting Jeju Island as well as the other high-latitude outlying coral communities
          of South Korea need to be pursued.</b> With the recent lift of the Covid-associated traveling restrictions, I hope to resume our work in South Korea & continue my collaborations
          with my Korean partners.
