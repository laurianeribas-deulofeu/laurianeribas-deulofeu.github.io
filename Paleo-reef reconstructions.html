                 Reefs are increasingly impacted by ongoing anthropogenically-caused climate change & the intensifying local human pressures that jeopardize the ability for coral reefs to persist in the near future.
                    However, changes in coral ecosystems have predated human underwater investigations. Fortunately, fossil reefs & the calcified remains within, are unique witnesses of the past, holding important 
                    physical, biological & chemical information. Studying these remains, in particular fossilized corals, allows scientists to reconstruct the functioning of the coral ecosystems prior to any anthropogenic
                    exploitation. The scientific community critically needs these pieces of past knowledge in order to adequately preserve reef functioning & ultimately ensure the survival of this crucial ecosystem.

         Numerous of outcrops of well preserved Holocene reefs can be observed along the coastlines of KNP. These outcrops provide perfect survey sites  
         for us to reconstruct the past diversity and global structure of Taiwanese reefs thousands of years before the Anthropocene era.
         At certain locations, these outcrops can be over 3 m tall & more than 5 m wide without discontinuity or obstruction, where past reef materials can be access at a minimal cost.
         On the other hand, fossilized materials from the outcrops are exposed to weathering are are unlikely to be ideal candidate for isotopic measurements and subsequent paleo-climate reconstructions. 
         Such studies will most likely require drilling of less exposed sections of the paleo-reefs, which could be found a few meters inland from the exposed reef outcrops.

                 During field investigations along the Dahan river bed in Shulin district, numerous small & fragile scleractinian fossils were found & identified as <i>Dendrophyllia</i> sp. (<a href="http://tao.cgu.org.tw/index.php/articles/archive/geology/item/1792" target="_blank">Ribas-Deulofeu et al. 2021</a>).
                 The fossils were collected from the lowest part of the Late Miocene Tapu Formation. The absolute age of the boundary between the Tapu Formation and the underlying Nanchuang Formation is 8 Ma, providing indications on the maximum age possible for the found <i>Dendrophyllia</i> fossils.
                 The marine ecosystem in which the sampled specimens grew was probably a turbid shallow coastal environment with muddy to sandy bottom, likely at the vicinity of a river estuary, as suggested by the combined presence of numerous Ariidae and Sciaenidae otoliths. 
                 To our knowledge, these are the first record of <i>Dendrophyllia</i> fossils from Taiwan.
