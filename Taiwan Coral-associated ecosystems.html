                    Located at the northern limit of the Coral Triangle, Taiwanese reefs are among the most diverse marine ecosystems on earth, hosting over a third of the world scleractinian diversity (558 species) and over 1484 reef fish species. 
       The environmental conditions alongside the steep topography surrounding Taiwan offer contrasted situations for coral communities & their associated organisms to develop & thrive.
                 In the Northern parts of the country, subtropical marginal coral communities are present, sometimes well developed  & occasionally bearing similitudes with the Okinawan and other Japanese coral-ecosystems. While the southern parts of the country, 
                 including offshore island such as Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼) or the more remote Dongsha (東沙) and Taiping (太平) Atolls present well developed & highly diverse reefs.
                 <br>
                 However, typhoons, bleaching events & anthropogenic disturbances exposure create gradient of degradations within Taiwan coral-associated ecosystems.
