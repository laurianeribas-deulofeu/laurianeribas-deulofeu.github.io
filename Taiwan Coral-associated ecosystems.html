                 Located at the northern limit of the Coral Triangle, Taiwanese reefs are among the most diverse marine ecosystems on earth, hosting over a third of the world scleractinian diversity (558 species) and over 1484 reef fish species. 
                 The environmental conditions alongside the steep topography surrounding Taiwan offer contrasted situations for coral communities & their associated organisms to develop & thrive.
                 In the Northern parts of the country, subtropical marginal coral communities are present, sometimes well developed  & occasionally bearing similitudes with the Okinawan and other Japanese coral-ecosystems. While the southern parts of the country, 
                 including offshore islands such as Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼) or the more remote Dongsha (東沙) and Taiping (太平) Atolls present well developed & highly diverse reefs.
                 <br>
                     <br>
                 The extraordinary biodiversity host by Taiwanese reefs along with the coastal protection and recreational activities offered by this ecosystem constitute a critical economical resource to the Taiwanese economy, with an average value of 514.417 US$/km2/year.
                 However, the multiple anthropogenic pressures along with the highly active typhoon regime and recurrent heat stress anomalies have induced major degradations of the Taiwanese reefs, making them one of the five most threatened reef regions in South-East Asia.
