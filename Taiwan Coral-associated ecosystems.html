                <p align="justify">
                 Located at the northern limit of the Coral Triangle, Taiwanese reefs are among the most diverse
                 marine ecosystems on earth, hosting over a third of the world's scleractinian diversity (558
                 species) and over 1,484 reef fish species. The environmental conditions alongside the steep
                 topography surrounding Taiwan offer contrasted situations for coral communities & their 
                 associated organisms to develop & thrive.In the Northern parts of the country, subtropical
                 marginal coral communities are present, sometimes well developed & occasionally bearing
                 similitudes with Japanese coral ecosystems. While the southern parts of the country, 
                 including offshore islands such as Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼), or the more remote Dongsha (東沙)
                 & Taiping (太平) Atolls present well developed & highly diverse reefs.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The extraordinary biodiversity hosted by Taiwanese reefs along with the coastal protection &
                 recreational activities offered by this ecosystem constitutes a critical economical resource to
                 the Taiwanese economy, with an estimated average value of 514,417 US$/km<sup>2</sup>/year. 
                 However, the multiple anthropogenic pressures along with the highly active typhoon regime &
                 recurrent heat stresses have induced major degradations of the Taiwanese reefs, making them one
                 of the five most threatened reef regions in South-East Asia.

                Since 2012, I was involved in & led several field surveys in Taiwan. Navigate through the map

              Over the recent decades, extreme events such as typhoons & bleaching events' recurrence & intensity
              have increased threatening coral reef ecosystems' survival.XXX
              
              Between 2015 to 2017, I studied the impacts of heat stress and typhoon events on the Kenting
              National Park's (KNP) reefs <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11744" target="_blank"> 
              (Ribas-Deulofeu et al. 2021a)</a>. Between August 2015 & April 2017, seven typhoons hit Taiwan
              (including two super-typhoons) while <i>in situ</i> seawater temperature in KNP reached a maximum
              of 31.2&deg;C, as opposed to an average maximum SST of 28.8&deg;C (2007-2016). The repeated storms
              in Taiwan lowered the levels of thermal stress during the 2015–2016 El Niño event.

             Structural complexity is an important feature to understand reef resilience abilities, through its role in mediating predator-prey interactions, regulating competition & promoting recruitment.
             During my Ph.D. degree, I proposed to quantify the relative contributions of fine & coarse rugosities in reef structural complexities <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.675853/full" target="_blank">(Ribas-Deulofeu et al. 2021b)</a>. 
             To do so, with my co-authors, we adapted the root mean square (Rq) of the deviation from assessed high-resolution depth profiles with polynomials. We compared our results on both theoretical & <i>in situ</i> transects with the chain method & the visual rugosity 
             index commonly used to characterize reef structural complexity.
