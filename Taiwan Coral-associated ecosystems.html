                 Located at the northern limit of the Coral Triangle, Taiwanese reefs are among the most diverse
                 marine ecosystems on earth, hosting over a third of the world's scleractinian diversity (558
                 species) and over 1,484 reef fish species. The environmental conditions alongside the steep
                 topography surrounding Taiwan offer contrasted situations for coral communities & their 
                 associated organisms to develop & thrive. In the Northern parts of the country, subtropical
                 marginal coral communities are present, sometimes well developed & occasionally bearing
                 similitudes with Japanese coral ecosystems. While the southern parts of the country, 
                 including offshore islands such as Ludao (綠島), Lanyu (蘭嶼), or the more remote Dongsha (東沙)
                 & Taiping (太平) Atolls present well developed & highly diverse reefs.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The extraordinary biodiversity hosted by Taiwanese reefs along with the coastal protection &
                 recreational activities offered by this ecosystem constitutes a critical economical resource to
                 the Taiwanese economy, with an estimated average value of 514,417 US$/km<sup>2</sup>/year. 
                 However, the multiple anthropogenic pressures along with the highly active typhoon regime &
                 recurrent heat stresses have induced major degradations of the Taiwanese reefs, making them one
                 of the five most threatened reef regions in South-East Asia.

      <h3 class="lead"id="anchor1">Typhoons & Bleaching events in Taiwan : a two-tailed story</h3><hr>
            <p align="justify">
              Over the recent decades, extreme events such as typhoons & bleaching events have increased in
              intensity & frequency, threatening coral reef ecosystems' survival. In 1998, a strong El Niño event
              triggered the first global mass-bleaching event & decimated about 16% of all coral reefs on Earth. 
              The formation of a strong El-Niño event in 2015-2016 has alerted the scientific community about the
              risk of an even more widespread & devastating mass-bleaching event than the one of 1998. 
              At the planetary scale, the 2015-2016 El-Niño event did lead to the most extensive &
              severe mass-bleaching event ever recorded. Globally, scientific reports have estimated that 75% of
              the reefs worldwide showed signs of bleaching during this period. Yet, the bleaching intensity was
              variable from region to region. <br>

            <p align="justify">
              In this context, from 2015 to 2017, I studied the <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11744" target="_blank">impacts of heat stress & typhoon events on Kenting National Park's (KNP) reefs (Ribas-Deulofeu et al. 2021a)</a>. 
              Between August 2015 & April 2017, seven typhoons hit Taiwan (including two super-typhoons), while
              <i>in situ</i> seawater temperature in KNP reached a maximum of 31.2&deg;C, as opposed to an average
              maximum SST of 28.8&deg;C (2007-2016). In Taiwan, the successive storms repeatedly lowered the levels
              of thermal stress during the 2015–2016 El Niño event.
              The maximum Degree Heating Week<sub>local</sub> (DHW) recorded in KNP only reached 3.1&deg;C weeks 
              (DHW<sub>region (NOAA)</sub> = 9.85&deg;C weeks) before the super-typhoon Meranti hit Kenting in 
              September 2016 & reduced the heat stress in the region. Additionnal storms & typhoons further helped
              cool seawaters & limited the impacts of this El Niño event on KNP's coral assemblages.
              Indeed, during the 2016 hot season, only an average of 2.2% of KNP benthic communities have bleached.

              <h8 id="floatright"><i>Example of typhoon Meranti breakage in KNP (09/2016, 5 m deep)</i></h8> 
              
              On the other hand, despite the overall coral cover in KNP remaining stable between 2015-2017, local 
              shifts were observed in the benthic composition, which could be related to mechanical damage caused 
              by storm disturbances. 
              In the long-term, the highly active typhoon regime in the region could lead to a shift toward a higher 
              contribution of mechanical damage-resistant corals in KNP, further decreasing the structural complexity of its reefs.<br> 
                
              <br>
              In the last three years (2020-2022), almost no typhoon has directly hit Taiwan which led to important 
              heat stress anomalies & recent mass-bleaching events, especially in the southern regions of the country.
              With the recent local lack of typhoons, Taiwan's coral ecosystems are facing worsening pressures from 
              global warming as they no longer benefit from repeated heat stress reliefs that were previously provided
              by successive typhoons during the hot season.

                Structural complexity is an important feature to understand reef resilience abilities, through its
                role in mediating predator-prey interactions, regulating competition & promoting recruitment. 
                During my Ph.D. degree, I proposed to quantify the relative contributions of fine & coarse
                <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.675853/full" target="_blank">rugosities in reef structural complexities (Ribas-Deulofeu et al. 2021b)</a>. 
                To do so, with my co-authors, we adapted the root mean square (Rq) of the deviation from assessed
                high-resolution depth profiles with polynomials. We compared our results on both theoretical &
                <i>in situ</i> transects with the chain method & the visual rugosity index commonly used to
                characterize reef structural complexity. <br>
                The Rq indices proposed as rugosity estimators in this study consider multiple levels of reef rugosity,
                which the chain method and the visual rugosity index fail to apprehend. Furthermore, relationships were
                found between Rq scores and specific functional groups in the benthic community. Indeed, the fine scale
                rugosity of the South Taiwan reefs mainly comes from biotic components such as hard corals, while their
                coarse scale rugosity is essentially provided by the topographic variations that reflect the geological
                context of the reefs. This approach allows identifying the component of the rugosity that could be managed
                and which could, ultimately, improve strategies designed for conservation.
